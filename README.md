# CompTIA-Acronym-Tester
Python3 application that helps you to learn acronyms required by various CompTIA certifications. The UX steps through a list of acronyms at your own comfortable pace. You try to remember the expanded phrase for each acronym. If you don't remember one, you mark it as incorrect. Your correct and incorrect recalls are tallied. You can continue to review the whole list, or only the incorrect ones. For each acronym, you can go to its Wikipedia page. This helps you learn concepts, not just memorize the phrases.

## Features
- Pre-created lists of acronyms, with the expanded phrase and Wikipedia link for each acronym
- Randomizes list of acronyms before each test run
- Hides expanded phrase until after you try to remember
- Review mode restricts the list to the incorrect ones, and as you remember more, the review list gets shorter
- Keyboard shortcuts allow quickly stepping through the list
- Length menu shows only acronyms with a specific length, so you can focus on the longer ones
